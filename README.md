# NLP Seminar 2018

In the last few years, there have been several breakthroughs concerning the methodologies used in Text Mining and Natural Language Processing (NLP). These breakthroughs originate from both new modeling frameworks as well as from improvements in computational resources.

In this seminar, we’re planning to review these frameworks starting with the neural probabilistic language model (Bengio et al, 2003) and continuing with discussing techniques like Word2Vec (Mikolov et al., 2013), Doc2Vec (Mikolov and Le, 2014) and GloVe (Pennington et al, 2014) as well as various other variants.

## Topics

-   The neural probabilistic language model & Introduction to neural networks
-   Explaining Word2Vec, Doc2Vec and FastText in detail
-   Bayesian Topic modeling: Latent dirichlet allocation and its applications
-   **Alternative Approaches: GloVe and Lda2Vec**
-   **Software for NLP: Tensorflow, gensim & text2vec; Comparison of Python and R**
-   **Application of deep networks for classification**
-   Dependency Parsing and Treebanks
-   **(Neural) Machine Translation**
-   Multilingual NLP 
-   RNNs in Natural Language Processing

This repository includes just the bold marked topics.
